		<h1>Issues:</h1>
		<p class="text-section">Believe it or not...coral reefs are living organisms just like us! Sadly our coral reefs are dying and here are the top three causes...<strong>water pollution, poison or dynamite pollution, and climate change.</strong> In this page, you will learn about the major issues contributing to the death of coral reefs! So without further ado, let's get started with coral reefs 101!!!</p>

      <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
			<p>Water pollution occurs when dangerous substances and foreign objects are introduced to the water.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Reefs are harmed when oil, fertilizer, and human or animal waste are dumped in the area. These elements change the chemical makeup of the water, while also blocking the sunlight that gives life to the reefs.</p>

    <div class="text-section">
      <h2>Poison or Dynamite Fishing</h2>
			<p>Poison or Dynamite Fishing is when a chemical known as cyanide is used to stun the fish and catch them easily. However, this practice causes the cyanide to get caught in the reef, poisoning the coral around it.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This practice is common in some countires where dynamite or blast fishing takes place. As the name suggests, cyanide explosives are used to stun a greater amount of fish to catch a huge load, resulting in the poisoning of coral nearby.</p>

    <div class="text-section">
			<h2>Climate Change</h2>
			<p>As climate change warms up our planet, the ocean warms up as well. Rising water temperatures cause the coral to release their internal microorganisms (which give them their vibrant colors). While bleached corals are not dead yet, they are more susceptable to disease and death due to high amounts of stress.</p>
